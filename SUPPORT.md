###### THIS IS THE SUPPORT PAGE FOR THE CHROME-EXTENSION ONLY! FOR ANY CREDIT OR QUESTION REGARDING HNSCHAT, PLEASE VISIT: [HNSCHAT](https://hnschat/), OR [HNS.CHAT](https://hns.chat/), CREATED BY @[ESKIMO](https://github.com/eskimo).

Welcome on the support page for the hnschat extension! 
If you are experiencing any problems with the extension at all, please contact me!
Hnschat chrome-extension is an independend and unfunded project with little to no resources. But we are happy to help however we can!
I was building another project when i got the idea of adding hnschat directly to the browser. So the last days I took a detour in my journey by developing a chrome-extensions anno 2022. I stripped out most of the wonkey code, because what's not there, cannot break. All it is now, is an iframe with hnschat, and some sizing-options.

#### RESOLVING HANDSHAKE NAMES
Even though adoption of the handshake protocol is coming rapidly, we aren't fully there yet!
So to resolve handshake names, you will have to install and/or configure some things yourself.
