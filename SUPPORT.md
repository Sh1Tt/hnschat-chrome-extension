# HNSCHAT CHROME-EXTENSION `SUPPORT`

###### THIS IS THE SUPPORT PAGE FOR THE CHROME-EXTENSION ONLY! FOR ANY CREDIT OR QUESTION REGARDING THE CHAT ITSELF, PLEASE VISIT [HNSCHAT](https://hnschat/) OR [HNS.CHAT](https://hns.chat/), CREATED BY [ESKIMO](https://github.com/eskimo).

Welcome on the support page for the chrome-extension. If you are experiencing any issues with the extension, please contact me!  
`hnschat chrome-extension` is an independend and unfunded project with little to no resources. But, we are happy to help however we can!  
I was working on another project, adding hnschat, when i got the idea to add it directly to the browser instead.  
So the last days I took a detour in my journey, writing a chrome-extension. In the end I stripped most of the fancy features, which where a little wonkey. What's not there, cannot break. All it is now, is a soure-option and some sizing-options, leaving hnschat 100% hnschat. But, now we can use it at work, or while watching a tutorial, or reading docs or smthng.. in the same window!  
If you have any questions regarding the extension, DM me [@_sh1tt](https://twitter.com/@_sh1tt).  
Please enjoy! Have a beautiful time!

## HELP

#### RESOLVING HANDSHAKE NAMES
Even though adoption of the handshake protocol is coming rapidly, we aren't fully there yet!
So to resolve handshake names, you will have to install and/or configure some things yourself.
You can visit the learning center from Namebase.io here: [learning center](namebase.io/learningcenter) to learn more.
For now, I'll give you two of my favourite options:
###### fingertip by impervious
- [fingertip](impervious.com/fingertip.html) for windows, mac and linux.
- [fingertip-on-android](https://gist.github.com/Noxturnix/d47eeab10ef95636391507b28ec84ff4) for android.
