Welcome on the support page for the hnschat extension! 
If you are experiencing any problems with the extension at all, please contact me!
Hnschat chrome-extension is an independend and unfunded project with little to no resources. But, we are happy to help however we can!
I was working on another project when i got the idea to add hnschat directly to the browser. So the last days I took a detour in my journey as developer by writing a chrome-extensions anno 2022. At the end I stripped most of the fancy features, which where a little wonkey. What's not there, cannot break. All it is now, is an iframe with a soure-option and some sizing-options, leaving hnschat 100% hnschat. But now I can use at work, or while watching a tutorial, or reading docs or smthng.. in the same window :) Please enjoy!

## HELP

#### RESOLVING HANDSHAKE NAMES
Even though adoption of the handshake protocol is coming rapidly, we aren't fully there yet!
So to resolve handshake names, you will have to install and/or configure some things yourself.
You can visit the learning center from Namebase.io here: [learning center](namebase.io/learningcenter) to learn more.
For now, I'll give you two of my favourite options:
###### fingertip by impervious
